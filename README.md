# Introduction

This project is a parser for s-expressions in C/C++. It was done by NathanaÃ«l Beaudoin-Dion in the holiday period of 2019 for the company GHGSat. [Enter here features, cross-plateform, etc.]

# Running the project

[Explain how to run the project]

## Windows

## Linux

## Raspberry Pi

# Methodology

[Explain how the project was made]
0. Research on S-Expressions
1. Make and setup simple hello world project with a simple Makefile for Windows
2. Implement the parsing of the .sexp files 
3. Implement the print for the string s-expression
3.1 Write comments and documentation
4. Make it cross-plateform / Check and research for CMake
4.1 Write comments and documentation
5. Make sure everything is good, git, doc, code, etc.

During my research on S-Expressions, I read that these expressions are like trees, so I thought about implementing a tree. Thing is, the more I thought about it, the more it seemed overkill. Trees are usefull when we want to search en element, when we want to reorganise the tree, to remove certain elements, and many other features. Since this project doesn't use these features, it is not necessary to implement a tree for the parser.
